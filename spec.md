## Basic Functionality
A button on the toolbar that takes all your open tabs and sends them to an 'inbox' screen (similar to OneTab).

## Expanded Functionality
* Ability to categorize links (once categorized, they'd be removed from the inbox?)
* Have the extension remind you about links older than a certain age (weekly?)
* Ability to have a daily reminder pop up prompting you to read one of your saved links - maybe suggest one, but allow the user to click through to choose a different one?
* Maybe have the extension auto-categorize incoming tabs by checking for keywords in the title?
